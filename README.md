This is simple PHP based website to update/view leave details of the Employee.
Used BOOTSTRAP in the FrontEnd .

How to start

1). Import emp.sql file to Create DataBase.
This website completly havely dependent on database so must include database .

2). Change the path/password of DATABASE 
-> Go to the config -> dbconnect.php (file) to make changes of database connectivity.


3). Since it's index file is .php file so you need run file in Apache web server.
//Apache is a web server.If you need to run php files in a web page, you need a web server and apache is one of the web servers available.

Note:
Since this website have more of Database connectivity i have done procedural programming .
